# Penny-Flute
The code to make my custom penny flute play silent night and we wish you a merry christmas


This was made on a D penny flute using an arudino uno, 6 sg90 servo motors, an lcd i2c screen, and a few other electronics. 
I will post a more inclusive list later.

Be careful with the amount of songs you have on there, currently you should comment out a few because it takes up too much memory for the arduino.

If you wish to add more, make sure you comment out the ones that are there right now.
